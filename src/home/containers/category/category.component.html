            For 50-year-old Md Mostafa and his wife, last weekend was nothing short of a nightmare. He shuttled from one
            hospital to another in the capital with his ailing wife Sathi Khanam, a kidney patient, only to be turned
            away.

            Sathi used to get dialysis done at the Kidney Foundation Hospital in Mirpur-2. But the hospital denied her
            treatment when they went there on Friday. It asked for her Covid-19 test report as a precondition for
            getting treatment.

            The couple rushed to Kurmitola General Hospital and then to Mugda General Hospital with the hope of either
            getting tested or treatment but all to no avail.

            They then went to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where they were told that only the patients admitted there
            could have their tests done.

            "I was in utter distress as I heard most of the private hospitals are not treating patients amid the crisis.
            Then I came to know about a clinic in Dhanmondi. I took her there and finally got her dialysis done," said
            Mostafa, who used to work at a launch on the Dhaka-Barishal route.

            Sathi is one of the few lucky patients who managed to get treatment during this pandemic.

            There have been reports that many hospitals -- both public and private -- are denying patients treatment
            despite repeated instructions and warnings from the government.

            Some hospitals demand Covid-19 test reports before hospitalisation, ignoring the fact that it now takes even
            a week to get test results. Besides, patients with Covid-19 symptoms were denied admission by hospitals
            though they tested negative for the virus.

            The health ministry issued an order on May 11, asking all private hospitals to keep separate arrangements
            for suspected coronavirus patients.
